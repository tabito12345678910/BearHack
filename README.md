Submission for Bear Hack 2025.

In the United States, healthcare is known for being needlessly complicated, making it difficult for people to make informed decisions.
Medoptima is a web application that aims to imporove information accessibility of healthcare's terms and payment plans, by allowing 
users to search for the most suitable insurance plan providers in their area according to their needs and preferences. 

The application also allows users to simulate costs for their most relevant services, and clarifies the entire process to make sure 
that they are fully aware of the extent of their coverage.

How to run:
- install node.js
- open terminal (powershell or cmd)
- - cd to root directory
- run mpm install
- run mpm run dev
